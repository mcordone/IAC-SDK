# IAC-SDK
This project constitutes the SDK application side of the test and used Java as the tech stack.  I took a Producer/Consumer design pattern approach to separate the component that produces events from the one that consumes the events. In this application, the producer component denotes a mobile device producing events and the consumer component an SDK consuming all events generated by the mobile device. Also, implemented a simplified retry mechanism when a Rest call throws an exception for example when the IAC-service is down.

Note: I added a PDF illustrating a few design approaches on architecting these kinds of applications taking into account scalability and resilience. Please find PDF under a folder named `wireframe.` 

##### Run application maven command (CLI):
-- mvn clean package -DskipTests && java -jar target/IAC-SDK-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

##### Run both application
To see these applications in action start both with the following commands in order:

Rest Service:
    `mvn clean package -DskipTests && java -jar target/iac-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

SDK App:
    `mvn clean package -DskipTests && java -jar target/IAC-SDK-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

To see the retry functionality, bring down (kill) the running IAC-service (Control-C), observe log output
